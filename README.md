The programming language I used for this project is Java. I actually created a Maven project to build this project. Good part of Maven is it create
a project structure. In the source directory in create 2 directories:

	1. main
	2. test
	
I wrote the problem solving method in the main directory and unit tests in the test directory. 

I used testng framework for writing the unit tests. Because it's a Maven project so the dependency is added in the pom.xml file.
To run the test we just need to go to the test class and from the class level click on the right button and run all the tests.
